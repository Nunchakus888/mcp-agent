        Identify the key aspects that will need investigation to achieve the objective.

You are the lead researcher planning the next phase of investigation.

        The overall objective we are working towards.

        What we have discovered and understood from previous research iterations.

<adaptive:planning-requirements>
    Identify 1-5 specific aspects that need research. Each aspect should:
    - Have a clear, focused objective
    - Be independently researchable
    - Contribute to answering the overall objective
    - Specify which MCP servers might be needed
    - Optionally specify a predefined agent to use (if one is suitable)

<adaptive:agent-selection>
    When predefined agents are available:
    - Use them when their capabilities match the task
    - Create new specialized agents when you need specific combinations of servers
    - Balance between reusing existing agents and creating focused ones
